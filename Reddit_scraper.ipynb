      "Reviews are really all over the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have one site saying it's as easily as good as the Bioshock games, and another saying \"has the most aggressively awful writing I've ever seen\".\n",
      "One of my friends got an early copy and he said the first act was a 9.5/10 but then turns to a mediocre mess after that. Overall he says the game is about a 6/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Seems like game was having an identity crisis of what it wanted to be from what he told me.\n",
      "Looks like they lacked focus and decided to try everything immediately. Open world elements, puzzles, driving, RPG elements, trying to write a compelling story, designing a world that feels lived in and rooted in alternate history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looks like they bit off more than they could chew, nevertheless. Good first attempt maybe?\n",
      "Reviews are all over the place, but if there is one thing certain, it's on Game Pass which means I'm not outright paying for it, I'll just play it and decide for myself. It looks goofy enough to give it a playthrough.\n",
      "I'm 3.5 hours into the game. So far, I'm really enjoying it...but it would be 10 times better with silent mc.\n",
      "He is so annoying, jesus.\n",
      "It nailed aesthetics and some combat, but I wish it also used much more of its initial concept of being a cosmic horror. I like the action flick and I think you will love it if you love B-movies, just wish it was different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully the dlc/sequel will fully utilise the concept arts. Imagine being a civilian at the countryside at the break, going through an amusement part (or LUNAPARK) and facing these…things as they evolve quickly to become hostile, where enemies can shred you apart and you navigate through the laboratory tripping up the atmosphere and such.\n",
      "What's the point of pre-loading if there's a day-1 68GB patch?\n",
      "That is my review for now.\n",
      "PowerPyx just let out a statement saying that they won't be making guides for this game because of its apparently poor and frustrating design. First time I've seen something like this come from them.\n",
      "About what I expected for this one to be honest. It’s a visually great game that doesn’t do enough in the mechanics department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, 20 hours? I was expecting half of that and, according to some of these reviews, the game doesn’t seem to earn its runtime.\n",
      "No FoV control? Forced mouse acceleration? What the fuck. EVERY single release has some stupid shit with it. Why can't we have a proper PC release?\n",
      "[Mortismal Gaming ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BUDVZWUF-Fo) also has a good review on the game after 100%.\n",
      "Finished the game over the weekend and had about 20 hours of fun. It really surprised me how much content this game had, considering it spend most of its life in some kind of limbo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storytelling is a mess though, strange revelations and plottwists every minute that make following the plot pretty hard, at least for me. But I thought the world they created was really captivating and I enjoyed reading emails, listening to logs and just digging deeper and deeper on what actually went on in the game. \n",
      "\n",
      "The graphics are beautiful, even though raytraced reflections were nowhere to be found on PC, which I thought was strange considering that this game was heavily used as a prime showcase for it. Made a lot of the complexes and facilities not *as pretty as they could’ve been*, because you can tell by all the metallic surfaces and mirrors everywhere that it’s designed with RT in mind. There's also no FOV slider, just FYI. I have a 3090 and a 9900KS and the game has no shader compilation stutters. It compiles its shaders in the beginning and then it’s pretty much smooth sailing from there. I was surprised how smooth the game ran even with everything maxed. Makes the artstyle in certain scenes really shine though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fights in this game are as bullet spongy as a few expected though, so I eventually put the game on easy and mowed my way through the robots. I thought this made the game way more fun, so I don’t have much to complain about the combat here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that’s really bad is the voice acting/localization. If people thought forspoken had bad writing then, by all means, brace yourself fellas, because this is going to be rough lmao.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall though I was pretty impressed with what Mundfish delivered and will give it a replay once they implement proper raytracing into the game.\n",
      "Yeah, I’m not gonna lie, this game is missing that “it” factor. I can’t really explain it but compared to bioshock there is both this since of awe and dread that makes the world feel alive. This game, something about it, just gives artificial vibes, like it’s too good to be true..\n",
      "I just played this game in gamepass for around 2 hours and couldn't convince myself to give a shit about a single thing in it. \n",
      "The movement is weird and floaty, there's forced acceleration, melee combat feels weirdly frantic and unpolished, and the dialogue is HORRENDOUS. The entire time I was giving them some measure of leeway, due to translations and all if that, but I realized about an hour in that the protagonist speaks exactly like shadow the hedgehog. There was legitimately a segment where you place a circular key into a slot, and the protagonist referred to it as a cookie, said the lock likes cookies, everyone likes cookies, then asked his onboard AI if it liked cookies. Twice.\n",
      "Gunplay is really the strong suit, but it felt flat and not really satisfying. And the one bioshock type ability I got was electricity, versus robots, and there was the same hit response as a melee attack.\n",
      "This game is kinda dogshit and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.\n",
      "Skill Up also didn’t recommend in his [Video Review](https://youtu.be/jXjq7zYCL-w).\n",
      "\n",
      "Weirdly, I expecting performance to be this games main issue. Instead, performance seems great but the writing and design ends up being its biggest missteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if this game would be more enjoyable on easy?\n",
      "IGN Review 8/10  \n",
      "\n",
      "The video review is so confusing, he literally spends the whole video length complaining about every single detail but at the end he gives it a solid 8/10.\n",
      "It's like Bioshock without the charm. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the dialogue tries to be edgy all the time. Holy shit. Who still writes script like this? \n",
      "\n",
      "The first 30 mins is exposition hell. You ride the same elevator twice while they explain shit to you. Story telling is a mess. \n",
      "\n",
      "Camera is headache inducing. \n",
      "Combat is slow.\n",
      "I’m getting Deja vu of Forspoken reviews where they said the main protagonist was unlikeable to the point where it actually becomes a detriment to the game. 2023 seems to be the year of the obnoxious main character so far but hopefully March will break this pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll give it a go on Game Pass why not, but I’ll keep my expectations thoroughly in check.\n",
      "Reviews range from \"This game is amazing\" to \"this game is complete garbage.\" I really like that. Now, I can look through more of the reviews and see similarities of problems and best features\n",
      "I watched a playthrough of it and was taken aback by the music in a certain part.\n",
      "\n",

      "They literally just ripped this from the Annihilation movie soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCuBalItZA8\n",
      "\n",
      "It's bizarre! And it's not just this one reviewer dubbing for copyright reasons either. I checked another playthrough and it had the same soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I just checked the credits and I don't see a nod to \"The Alien\". So I guess they just ripped it lmfao\n",
      "From looking at multiple reviews in full the general consensus seems to be all over the place, but every single review, even the most negative one (SkillUp's video from what I've watched) say that they did enjoy the game all the way through. Good enough to give it a shot on GamePass for me after I'm done with Retrurnal and Persona 5 Royal\n",
      "As a reviewer myself, I'm honestly surprised to see all the more positive reviews. The game reminded me of Duke Nukem Forever, a jumbled mess of semi finished ideas lacking focus and a single cohesive thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also its hilarious seeing all the images of the big mommy robots that appear for like two seconds, unlike the rapey weapons upgrade machine which pops up every two minutes.\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "Reviews appear a little disappointing, especially given the hype that’s been several years in the making. Looks like a perfect game to try on Game Pass really.\n",
      "Can't help but wonder how many of these negative reviews are due to politics? \n",
      "\n",
      "2 hours in and the game is a ton of fun. Sure it has some issues with the poor voice acting and the dialogue in general but the performance is top notch, it looks amazing and the combat is pretty damn fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I've just not encountered the problematic enemies so far but the game is quick with giving you the ability to upgrade your weapons and the basic robots go down in 1-2 shots with the shotgun on the hard difficulty.\n",
      "Not every game can be as great as Red Dead Redemption 2 but that doesn't make it Sonic 06 by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we kinda tend to forget that some games are just \"okay\" or \"pretty good\" and there's nothing wrong with that tbh. I'm sure this would be great to play on Gamepass or on sale\n",
      "When I first saw these trailers, saw the lack of history of the devs and the weird immediate preorder systems, I never thought this game would see the light of day. I am surprised it made it this far, and even more surprised that it is getting fairly mediocre reviews (with some exceptions). I might give it a go on game pass, but overall I probably wouldn't have purchased this with so many good options out there.\n",
      "I normally love most games that get divisive reviews, but I saw \"bullet sponge enemies\", \"padding\", and \"boring level design (gameplay)\", so guess I'm passing.\n",
      "I’ve not reviewed it, but I am playing it for guides and have sunk around 12 hours in so far - personally surprised with a lot of the negative reviews as I’m largely enjoying my time with it so far. Happy to field any specific Qs anyone has about the game.\n",
      "I have been noticing how many of the games coming to day 1 gamepass are so divisive and yet unique. Scorn, high on life and now atomic heart. Reminds me of ps2 days when we used to get, rough around the edges, wierd and unique games which tried many things. \n",
      "These games are not mainstream and definately not for everyone.\n",
      "I kinda respect gamepass for that. After playing many AAA games especially playstation titles like horizon, days gone, ghost of tsushima and recently ragnarok, i was getting really bored of gaming.\n",
      "Overall it seems to be a 'good but not great' game, which honestly is more than I expected after all the dev hell and issues over the years. As long as the performance isn't so rough it ruins the game, it looks like something I will find fun on the GamePass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: After playing a bit... it seems pretty poor. Incredible visual design but poor everything else. It has mediocre gameplay and some of the worst writing/voice acting I can remember for a protagonist.\n",
      "This would be the perfect game to have gamepass for. This with Wo Long, Starfield, Lies of P, and Forza all coming this year... maybe its time to finally get a series X/gamepass. Also need to try Hi-Fi rush\n",
      "I’m confused how no one is at least praising this games optimization. Native 4k “dungeons” at 60 fps and open world up scaled to 4k at 60 fps with out having to pick a performance mode to me is amazing and I cant wait to play that.\n",
      "This game tires me out and it doesn't respect my time. The inability to save whenever and imbalance of power, even on easy setting, makes it very unforgiving to simply start with, and have to replay over and over without being a roguelike. The way it teaches you the mechanics is also awful and it repeats them on consequent reloads from save games.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's with games having annoying monologuing character sidekicks that don't shut up? High on life, Forspoken and this. It's like a Infinite Improbability Drive to gloss over bad writing and poor plot planning.\n",
      "Sounds like the 20-hour runtime, combined with the awful writing, totally compromised the aspects of the design and combat that are above average. Really a shame, but I think we all expected this game to trip and fall on its face in *some* capacity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, should be fun for a weekend on Gamepass.\n",
      "Just tried it on Game Pass and uninstalled it about an hour later. \n",
      "\n",
      "The setting is genuinely superb and it really should have been something I liked, but I absolutely hate the combat. It feels loose and clunky. Just can't get on with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The protagonist is so fucking annoying too. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if you have Game Pass, I still recommend trying it out. I think some people will still really like this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not difficult to see why reviews are all over the place.\n",
      "I'm 3 hours in. The first hour of just walking around and seeing the world had me amazed, the game is absolutely beautiful and the designs are so creative and unique. Never seen a game so impressive visually. Ran smoothly as well on max settings (2070 super). But wow, the gameplay is horrible and tedious. It feels clunky, the weapons feel like ass and so do the abilities. The worst part for me is the fact that you need to loot EVERYTHING just to have enough ammo to use your guns and not be stuck with the unintuitive melee combat. If you die (which just in the first few hours I have a few times from being trapped in a corner by enemies that spawned behind me) you do not keep the loot you got before your death, meaning you need to spend minutes relooting before trying the fight again. I wish I could like this game as its world is entrancing, but I cannot bring myself to muddle through this horrible gameplay. Unfortunate as I was super excited and the gameplay looks good in trailers and such.\n",
      "About 5 hours in so far. The reviews/comments about the writing and dialogue being terrible are well overstated, its in-line with other macho fps games, Wolfenstein especially. \n",
      "\n",
      "If anything it seems like it was written in one language and doesn't translate to English's 100% and losses the humour of it like with the sex crazy upgrade machine. But its no where near enough of a thing to complain much about. \n",
      "\n",
      "For gameplay it doesn't explain much or incentivise you to use your elemental powers much if at all and if you miss the splash screen when you first unlock them then you'd forget  them altogether. No enemies or puzzles really need them to used for so far. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's a bunch of other things of that nature that are also not explained much and feels like it lacks that kind of polish of unlocking weapons/powers dopamine do much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice acting I would say is awkward to bad and I wish there was a Russian V.O. option. VO is only as good as its directed and it feels very awkward listening to all these American voices in place of Russian/slavics about Soviet Russia, saying \"com RAIDS\" in place of comrades (lol wtf) and I would've been more comfortable with an English cast like so many movies and tv series do with stories of that area. \n",
      "\n",
      "The story is a bit over the place and its hard to be invested because of the voices, I had this same problem with Horizon: Zero dawn. People thousands of years in the future in tribes with broken teethers to the old times that can somehow speak perfect English like they're theatre kids doing a play. Major disconnect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Graphically its stunning at times and others generic but never bad. A problem I had with the Gamepass version on my tv was Vsync was un-selectable. Found a steam discussion saying to enable frame generation (even if you dont have a 40xx series Nvidia card) > restart the game > then you'll be able to turn Vsync on. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all its good game so far for a first time effort and a bit of ambitiousness it feels inline with its comrades especially like the Wolfenstein series.\n",
      "Great graphics\n",
      "Great story\n",
      "Great controls\n",
      "Great music \n",
      "Great sound FX \n",
      "Great voice acting \n",
      "\n",
      "Normaly I like open world games but this very linear game kept my interest right away.  The puzzles aren't hard enough to be frustrating.  Some people say the combat is really hard.  Being familiar with FPS games in general helps a lot. The telekenesis powers make looting fun in a whole new way.  Each area has plenty of interesting things to look at and rewards for exploring it.  The robot designs are really interesting and have a lot of character.  The game does a good job with waypoints to keep people from gerting lost.   This game will probably win a few awards for it's presentation in general.  I got it free on Gamepass, another great addition and reason to get the service.\n",
      "Started the game today and played for about 2 hours. For me that was plenty of time to see what a shitshow this game is. I uninstalled it a minute ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphically the game looks great and it really impressed me at first. But good graphics don't make a good game. The main character is so annoying!!! Constantly making off-topic jokes, complaining about everything around him and not being engaged in the things that happen around him at all. The cringy jokes and comments made me hate this character in the first few minutes already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combat is just plain bad. I like it when a shooter game mixes up things and makes us have certain skills or abilities to use in battles. But the robots you're fighting are sponges and there's not really anything you can do about that. 1v1 fights are doable, as long as you time you dodges right but as soon as another robot joins the fight you're screwed if all you're using is your axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure there's people out there that'll love this game and that's great! It's not my game though. Overall the only good thing I can say about the game is that the graphics are nice. I hated the rest of the game. And I was really excited to try it out and scratch that Bioshock/ Fallout itch I had. But it didn't scratch my itch. It only made the spot that itched bigger!\n",
      "Every time I see a unknown game with a eye catching art style get announced for day 1 GamePass or PS+ I just assume it’s getting a high 60s / mid 70s MC score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feels like there is a entire sub genre of \"ehhh.  its fine I guess\" for games that launch day 1 on a sub.\n",
      "Seeing two reviews claim it has the worst writing ever and also great writing is fucking hilarious to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this going to be another Deadly Premonition situation where the charm of the game overweighs critics and becomes a cult classic, or is it just mediocre? I guess we'll decide in a few years.\n",
      "I just watched the Skill Up review, and he seems to think it was an overall flawed game. Saying combat felt unbalanced, especially in the open sections, and that a lot of the writing and dialogue is kind of cringe. (Some clips he showed set off my cringe sensors hard especially the upgrade AI who apparently just spouts graphic sexual innuendo the whole game, seems like it would grt grating fast and I dunno how the voice actor got through that) I think I'll wait for a sale or just \"borrow it\" someday. Or maybe just skip. I can say without doubt just from watching a few reviews that the game is not AT ALL an immersive sim.\n",
      "I'm starting to realize that mixed scores like this means I'll like it. Days Gone, Forspoken, The Order 1886, are reviewed similarly and I enjoyed all those games and even platinumed Forspoken.\n",
      "Looks like a case of wait for a sale and (at least on PC) for the performance to be mostly fixed. Or get it on Gamepass I guess.\n",
      "reviews be all over the place. very thankful for steam's refund policy - gonna give this the ol' 2-hour-try and see how it goes\n",
      "Just looking at the scores make me want to disregard the 9/10 or 90% reviews. The game seems to have real problems that these reviews seem to just gloss over or outright ignore. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still looks like fun though and I'll probably play it after a bit and when it's on sale. Maybe they will iron out the issues by then.\n",
      "As soon as I learned about the mechanics behind repair drones, bullet sponge enemies, and nearly impossible stealth, I lost all my hype. Even gamepass won't get me to try it because of hard drive space of all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd rather just play Prey again\n",
      "Does everyone forget how cringe the original Metro was? That game has just as many issues as it doesn't, and its still a completely loveable game. With this being a Russian made game, I am highly expecting some cringe. Aand that's okay...\n",
      "After the surprise that was Hogwarts Legacy I was slightly hopeful that this *might* turn out good despite looking really mediocre but I guess it's just your typical eurojank that has a neat concept but suffers from being way too overambitious, shame\n",
      "I love Mick Gordon, I love awesome graphics, I tend to enjoy even the shittiest of games so it looks like I'll love this one.\n",
      "The most comprehensive and accurate review I’ve seen is on YouTube, Before You Buy on Gameranx’s channel.\n",
      "Game kinda sucks.. I actually really like the setting and premise and all of that jazz but the actual gameplay just feels extremely clunky and boring to me.\n",
      "I liked it. The only complaints I've had are the Crispy Critters lines are abundant and it's length. I want more. Ya know?\n",
      "I tried. I really tried to get into this game and enjoy it. I wanted to like it so badly....but I really don't. The voice acting and dialogue are abysmal, literally every aspect of the gameplay is clunky as hell, and it's riddled with bugs of varying severity. The final straw came not long after I gained access to the open world portion of the game, in which I encountered a bug that made it impossible to aim, shoot, or interact with anything in any way. I was forced to reload my previous save, made over half an hour earlier. Immediately uninstalled. I'm just glad I was able to play it via Game Pass rather than wasting my money paying full price for this piece of shit.\n",
      "Glad I bought the game from the devs website back in 2019 for only $30. Just received my Steam Key this morning. Stoked to play it\n",
      "Mixed reviews is exactly what I was expecting. A lot of it looks neat, but having thumbed through a few reviews and videos now, it definitely has some things I don't really want to deal with. Boring and cumbersome open world, extended boring puzzles, and more all make this a solid game pass game for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully they get to make a sequel and sand off these rough edges, because there is a truly interesting and unique looking game under there\n"

       "      <td>Finished the game over the weekend and had about 20 hours of fun. It really surprised me how much content this game had, considering it spend most of its life in some kind of limbo.\\n\\nThe storytelling is a mess though, strange revelations and plottwists every minute that make following the plot pretty hard, at least for me. But I thought the world they created was really captivating and I enjoyed reading emails, listening to logs and just digging deeper and deeper on what actually went on in the game. \\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful, even though raytraced reflections were nowhere to be found on PC, which I thought was strange considering that this game was heavily used as a prime showcase for it. Made a lot of the complexes and facilities not *as pretty as they could’ve been*, because you can tell by all the metallic surfaces and mirrors everywhere that it’s designed with RT in mind. There's also no FOV slider, just FYI. I have a 3090 and a 9900KS and the game has no shader compilation stutters. It compiles its shaders in the beginning and then it’s pretty much smooth sailing from there. I was surprised how smooth the game ran even with everything maxed. Makes the artstyle in certain scenes really shine though.\\n\\nThe fights in this game are as bullet spongy as a few expected though, so I eventually put the game on easy and mowed my way through the robots. I thought this made the game way more fun, so I don’t have much to complain about the combat here.\\n\\nThe only thing that’s really bad is the voice acting/localization. If people thought forspoken had bad writing then, by all means, brace yourself fellas, because this is going to be rough lmao.\\n\\nOverall though I was pretty impressed with what Mundfish delivered and will give it a replay once they implement proper raytracing into the game.</td>\n",

The puzzles aren't hard enough to be frustrating.  Some people say the combat is really hard.  Being familiar with FPS games in general helps a lot. The telekenesis powers make looting fun in a whole new way.  Each area has plenty of interesting things to look at and rewards for exploring it.  The robot designs are really interesting and have a lot of character.  The game does a good job with waypoints to keep people from gerting lost.   This game will probably win a few awards for it's presentation in general.  I got it free on Gamepass, another great addition and reason to get the service.</td>\n",

Never seen a game so impressive visually. Ran smoothly as well on max settings (2070 super). But wow, the gameplay is horrible and tedious. It feels clunky, the weapons feel like ass and so do the abilities. The worst part for me is the fact that you need to loot EVERYTHING just to have enough ammo to use your guns and not be stuck with the unintuitive melee combat. If you die (which just in the first few hours I have a few times from being trapped in a corner by enemies that spawned behind me) you do not keep the loot you got before your death, meaning you need to spend minutes relooting before trying the fight again. I wish I could like this game as its world is entrancing, but I cannot bring myself to muddle through this horrible gameplay. Unfortunate as I was super excited and the gameplay looks good in trailers and such.</td>\n",

The entire time I was giving them some measure of leeway, due to translations and all if that, but I realized about an hour in that the protagonist speaks exactly like shadow the hedgehog. There was legitimately a segment where you place a circular key into a slot, and the protagonist referred to it as a cookie, said the lock likes cookies, everyone likes cookies, then asked his onboard AI if it liked cookies. Twice.\\nGunplay is really the strong suit, but it felt flat and not really satisfying. And the one bioshock type ability I got was electricity, versus robots, and there was the same hit response as a melee attack.\\nThis game is kinda dogshit and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.</td>\n",

       "4  Finished the game over the weekend and had about 20 hours of fun. It really surprised me how much content this game had, considering it spend most of its life in some kind of limbo.\\n\\nThe storytelling is a mess though, strange revelations and plottwists every minute that make following the plot pretty hard, at least for me. But I thought the world they created was really captivating and I enjoyed reading emails, listening to logs and just digging deeper and deeper on what actually went on in the game. \\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful, even though raytraced reflections were nowhere to be found on PC, which I thought was strange considering that this game was heavily used as a prime showcase for it. Made a lot of the complexes and facilities not *as pretty as they could’ve been*, because you can tell by all the metallic surfaces and mirrors everywhere that it’s designed with RT in mind. There's also no FOV slider, just FYI. I have a 3090 and a 9900KS and the game has no shader compilation stutters. It compiles its shaders in the beginning and then it’s pretty much smooth sailing from there. I was surprised how smooth the game ran even with everything maxed. Makes the artstyle in certain scenes really shine though.\\n\\nThe fights in this game are as bullet spongy as a few expected though, so I eventually put the game on easy and mowed my way through the robots. I thought this made the game way more fun, so I don’t have much to complain about the combat here.\\n\\nThe only thing that’s really bad is the voice acting/localization. If people thought forspoken had bad writing then, by all means, brace yourself fellas, because this is going to be rough lmao.\\n\\nOverall though I was pretty impressed with what Mundfish delivered and will give it a replay once they implement proper raytracing into the game.\n",

The puzzles aren't hard enough to be frustrating.  Some people say the combat is really hard.  Being familiar with FPS games in general helps a lot. The telekenesis powers make looting fun in a whole new way.  Each area has plenty of interesting things to look at and rewards for exploring it.  The robot designs are really interesting and have a lot of character.  The game does a good job with waypoints to keep people from gerting lost.   This game will probably win a few awards for it's presentation in general.  I got it free on Gamepass, another great addition and reason to get the service.\n",

The first hour of just walking around and seeing the world had me amazed, the game is absolutely beautiful and the designs are so creative and unique. Never seen a game so impressive visually. Ran smoothly as well on max settings (2070 super). But wow, the gameplay is horrible and tedious. It feels clunky, the weapons feel like ass and so do the abilities. The worst part for me is the fact that you need to loot EVERYTHING just to have enough ammo to use your guns and not be stuck with the unintuitive melee combat. If you die (which just in the first few hours I have a few times from being trapped in a corner by enemies that spawned behind me) you do not keep the loot you got before your death, meaning you need to spend minutes relooting before trying the fight again. I wish I could like this game as its world is entrancing, but I cannot bring myself to muddle through this horrible gameplay. Unfortunate as I was super excited and the gameplay looks good in trailers and such.\n",

The entire time I was giving them some measure of leeway, due to translations and all if that, but I realized about an hour in that the protagonist speaks exactly like shadow the hedgehog. There was legitimately a segment where you place a circular key into a slot, and the protagonist referred to it as a cookie, said the lock likes cookies, everyone likes cookies, then asked his onboard AI if it liked cookies. Twice.\\nGunplay is really the strong suit, but it felt flat and not really satisfying. And the one bioshock type ability I got was electricity, versus robots, and there was the same hit response as a melee attack.\\nThis game is kinda dogshit and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.\n",
